## Description
***
I have added the Jquery library in order to be able to use some plugins of this library. Sticky-Kit is implemented to have a menu that doesn't dissapear when the user scroll down. SmartMenus together with dryMenu is used to have a stylish dropdown menu in the version mobil. I order to handle a carousel of elements in services section I added the plugin caroufredsel. Isotope and imagesloaded work together to show a image with a text when the user hover of a service.
Also, this website uses Open Graph to represent the content of the page. This metadata allows insert automatically an image and information of the website when the user sends the site link in an app like whatsapp or facebook.

### Optimization
* This website uses images with extension .webp for the browsers that support them, for the other browsers the site gives the images in jpg or png format.
* In order to improve loading performance of the page this website load some scripts asynchronously with async and defer attributes. This allow that the "iframe" code don't harm the performance of the site.
